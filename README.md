# Test Panda: What do i want to learn?

- [ ] install google fonts
- [ ] component styles (similar to chakra)
- [ ] modal useDisclosure props
- [ ] responsive styling


# Notes

### Unable to have both object & template literal notation
It seems I can only use one or the other. This is a setting enabled in the `panda.config.js` under the `syntax` option

### jsx styled enables similar chakra experience
can get a similar chakra like experience with styled jsx

```
import { styled } from "@/styled-system/jsx";


<styled.button bg="blue">this is a button</styled.button>
```
